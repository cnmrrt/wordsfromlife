                <li>Whatever you are, be a good one.</li>
                <li>America will never be destroyed from the outside. If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be
                    because we destroyed ourselves.</li>
                <li>I'm a success today because I had a friend who believed in me and I didn't have the heart to let
                    him down.</li>
                <li>Those who look for the bad in people will surely find it.</li>
                <li>There are no bad pictures; that's just how your face looks sometimes.</li>
                <li>When you reach the end of your rope, tie a knot and hang on.</li>
                <li>Be sure you put your feet in the right place, then stand firm.</li>
                <li>I don't like that man. I must get to know him better.</li>
                <li>I would rather be a little nobody, then to be a evil somebody.</li>
                <li>If I were two-faced, would I be wearing this one?</li>
                <li>Character is like a tree and reputation its shadow. The shadow is what we think it is and the
                    tree is the real thing.</li>
                <li>My best friend is a person who will give me a book I have not read.</li>
                <li>No man is poor who has a Godly mother.</li>
                <li>All that I am or ever hope to be, I owe to my angel mother.</li>
                <li>Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any one thing.
                </li>
                <li>I laugh because I must not cry, that is all, that is all.</li>
                <li>I will prepare and some day my chance will come.</li>
                <li>No man has a good enough memory to be a successful liar.</li>
                <li>The best way to predict your future is to create it.</li>
                <li>The best thing about the future is that it comes one day at a time.</li>
                <li>Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.</li>
                <li>All I have learned, I learned from books.</li>
                <li>Nearly all men can stand <a href="/words/adversity">adversity</a>, but if you want to test a
                    man's character, give him power.</li>
                <li>Those who deny freedom to others, deserve it not for themselves.</li>
                <li>Do I not destroy my enemies when I make them my friends?</li>
                <li>Whenever I hear anyone arguing for slavery, I feel a strong impulse to see it tried on him
                    personally.</li>
                <li>Books serve to show a man that those original thoughts of his aren't very new after all.</li>
                <li>Folks are usually about as happy as they make their minds up to be.</li>
                <li>I am a slow walker, but I never walk back.</li>
